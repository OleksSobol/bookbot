# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## What does it do?

BookBot analyzes a text file (like a book) and prints:
- The total word count
- The count of each character (letters, symbols, spaces), sorted by frequency

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the program from the command line, providing the path to your book file:

```sh
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```

Example:

```sh
python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
```

## Output

The program will print:
- The file path being analyzed
- The total number of words
- A list of each character and how many times it appears, sorted by count

Enjoy analyzing your book!
